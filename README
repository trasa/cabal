"CABAL" - an Axis&Allies multiplayer clone 

This was an experiment to give me a chance to play with WPF, Silverlight,
and WCF to tie things together. 

If I were to pick this project up again, I would NOT use WPF but instead 
would write the front end using Unity or something better suited to 2D 
board manipulation.  WPF required too much work, took away from the joy
of writing AI.

Using:
* WPF for the client (displaying a 2D 'game board' using mechanics commonly 
  found in RTS games)
* WCF for communications to the server
* MVC to host the server side of the game
* a (sort of) competitive AI hosted at the server to compete against.
  (Ok, not really competitive.  Or complete.)
